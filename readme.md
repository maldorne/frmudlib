# `frmudlib` MUD library

This was the old mudlib from the game **Final Realms** during the nineties. It includes only the mudlib without the game content (the _domains_).

This was the license:

```
----  The FR mudlib version 3.4 ----
(c)opyright Final Realms 1992-1998.

Licence.

You are granted license to use and modify all code in this distribution as
long as you mail mudadm@fr.imaginary.com with a notice that you are using it.


Have fun with it.
For the FR-MUD development team.
